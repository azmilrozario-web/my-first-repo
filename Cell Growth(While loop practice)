# take the initial cell population as input
cells = int(input())

# take the number of days as input
days = int(input())

# initialize the day counter
counter = 1

# complete the while loop
while counter <= days:
    cells = cells * 2

    # Daily message
    print("Day " + str(counter) + ": " + str(cells))

    counter = counter + 1

#A powerful beginner trick (do this mentally)
Before running a while loop, always ask:
❓ Three survival questions
What is the condition?
→ counter <= days
What changes that condition?
→ counter = counter + 1
When will it become false?
→ when counter becomes days + 1
If you can answer those three, you understand the loop.
